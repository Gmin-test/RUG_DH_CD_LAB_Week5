Palestinian president Mahmoud Abbas has met US national security adviser Jake Sullivan, a day after the Biden government official met Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu. Abbas told Sullivan that Gaza was an “integral” part of the Palestinian state. He called for the aggression to stop, and for civilians to not be targeted by Israel. Sullivan told a press conference that Israel will begin to target its war efforts at the leadership of Hamas, and on intelligence-led operations. At least three people have been killed in Israeli shelling of a UN-run school in Khan Younis, in southern Gaza. The death tolls vary, with Al Jazeera citing doctors who said that 33 have died in the attack. Two journalists for Al Jazeera have been injured while covering the attack in Khan Younis. Wael Al-Dahdouh and Samer Abu Daqqa were hurt after a drone fired a missile at the area. The attack has been condemned by several journalists’ bodies, including the Committee to Protect Journalists who said the war is “the deadliest conflict for journalists” in three decades. The bodies of three Israelis who were kidnapped and killed by Hamas have been returned to Israel. Elya Toledano, 28, who was attending the Nova Music festival with friends, as well as two army soldiers Corporal Nick Beizer, 19,and Sergeat Ron Sherman, 19, have been confirmed to have died after being taken hostage. Israeli special forces also recovered the body of a 28-year-old hostage, who has not been named. 130 remain in Gaza. The Israeli army has dropped leaflets on southern Lebanon warning residents not to help Hezbollah. The UK has joined calls for settler violence against Palestinians in the West Bank to stop.

Many of the estimated 60,000 Americans living in the West Bank outside of occupied East Jerusalem moved to settlements for the lifestyle and have little to do with the Palestinians on whose land they live. But a core of ideologically driven US citizens were at the forefront of building religious settlements on land expropriated from Palestinians while others have led the rise of what has been described as “settler terrorism”.

Colonna will call for “restraint” and “responsibility” to avoid a new frontline on the Israeli-Lebanese border, he said.

All communication and internet services were completely cut off in Gaza on Thursday, Palestinian telecommunication companies said. The Israeli military said soldiers were facing disciplinary action after violating its code of conduct during an “operational activity” near a mosque in the West Bank city of Jenin. The soldiers were seen on video singing Hanukkah songs and mocking the Islamic call to prayer over loudspeaker in the mosque during a raid. The incident came during three days of raids in the occupied West Bank, during which Israeli troops killed 12 Palestinians, including one youth shot dead at a hospital, Palestinian officials and international health charities said. The Palestinian Football Association says it has documented the killing of 85 Palestinian athletes, including 55 football players and 30 players in other sports, since the start of the war, the Palestinian news agency Wafa reported. The association said in a report on Thursday that Israeli forces “targeted Palestinian athletes and sports facilities, especially football players and club presidents, administrators, referees and others”, according to Wafa. At least 18,787 Palestinians have been killed and 50,897 wounded in Israeli strikes on Gaza since 7 October, the Hamas-run Gaza health ministry said on Thursday. The strikes followed Hamas’s attack that killed about 1,200 people in Israel, with more than 200 others taken hostage.', 'lastModifiedDate': '2023-12-15T05:34:49Z'}]}
