In a historic move, the European Council decided to open accession negotiations with Ukraine and Moldova. Hungary’s prime minister, Viktor Orbán, in the morning doubled down on his position opposing opening accession negotiations with Kyiv. French president Emmanuel Macron, German chancellor Olaf Scholz and senior EU officials met with Orbán ahead of the summit in a bid to bring him on board. Addressing the EU leaders via videoconference, Volodymyr Zelenskiy asked heads of state and government not to “betray” faith in Europe. After hours of talks, Orbán walked out the room as leaders formally made the decision to open accession talks – thus getting unanimity. The Hungarian prime minister said “Hungary does not want to share in this bad decision, and for this reason Hungary did not participate in the decision today.” European Council president Charles Michel called the leaders’ decision to open accession talks a “very powerful political signal.” Zelenskiy said “this is a victory for Ukraine. A victory for all of Europe. A victory that motivates, inspires, and strengthens.” Maia Sandu, Moldova’s president, said her country “turns a new page today.” Asked about Orbán’s comments following the decision, Belgian prime minister Alexander De Croo said “or, if you’re a part of a decision, you agree with the decision, or afterwards you just have to keep your mouth shut.” The European Council also decided to grant the status of candidate country to Georgia, on the understanding that the relevant steps set out in a Commission recommendation are taken. The European Council also said the bloc will open accession negotiations with Bosnia and Herzegovina, once the necessary degree of compliance with the membership criteria is achieved. Leaders discussed proposed changes to the bloc’s long-term budget, including a new financial package for Ukraine.', 'lastModifiedDate': '2023-12-15T00:05:33Z'}, {'id': '657b8e3c8f08d04fc5204f34', 'bodyTextSummary': 'Belgium’s prime minister, Alexander De Croo, drew attention with comments reacting to Viktor Orbán’s decision to leave the room while leaders made their decision on Ukraine.

But the EU’s dramatic showdown with Orbán did serve as a reminder of the tough road ahead for the EU as it prepares to enlarge. The bloc already grapples with how to address rule of law problems and foreign policy divergences in countries such as Hungary, and many leaders recognise that the EU would have to reform internally before expanding. At Thursday’s summit, leaders also debated the EU’s budget as some member states resist paying more into the bloc’s coffers – another reminder of the challenges ahead if the EU accepts new members that will take up a significant chunk of budget spending.', 'lastModifiedDate': '2023-12-14T20:02:30Z'}, {'id': '657b5df18f0822ad14b8f7c5', 'bodyTextSummary': 'For weeks, Hungarian prime minister Viktor Orbán insisted that he would block the move, which formally requires unanimous approval from all 27 member states. His veto threats dominated conversations in Brussels cafés, as diplomats shook their heads and asked, what does he really want? And what do we do? The European Council president, Charles Michel, flew to Budapest to try to bring the Hungarian leader on board. French president Emmanuel Macron hosted Orbán in Paris. In a last-minute effort, Macron and German chancellor Olaf Scholz were among the senior leaders who sat down with the Hungarian leader. Meanwhile, in a move critics have described as a bribe, the European Commission unfroze around 10 billion euros earmarked for Hungary, arguing that the country successfully completed judicial reforms. In the end, after hours of talks on Thursday, Orbán relented – walking out of the room while the other 26 leaders agreed to start negotiations with Ukraine and Moldova, thus allowing for a unanimous decision. Nevertheless, the days of uncertainty and diplomatic campaign to bring Hungary onboard highlighted that despite his high profile on the European stage, Orbán is a lonely figure – at least for now. “Orbán achieved what was to be expected - he got self-isolated, by his own choice,” said a senior EU diplomat. There is speculation that Orbán may be betting on a strong performance for the European far-right in upcoming elections, biding his time for when more like-minded leaders might sit around the table. But the Hungarian prime minister’s ultimate decision to seemingly back off a threat he had publicly repeated for days puzzled even some of his own colleagues. “Nobody understands what’s happened,” admitted a Hungarian official.', 'lastModifiedDate': '2023-12-14T20:03:47Z'}, {'id': '657b52c58f088fb81bf43efe', 'bodyTextSummary': 'Roberta Metsola, president of the European parliament, said: “This is a proud moment for Europe.

What struck me most was the disparity between the mood inside the chamber and the mood outside it. On the sidelines, reporters opened their questions by asserting that the war had reached a “stalemate” and that “war fatigue” would cripple support, before wondering why Ukraine wouldn’t offer to trade territory for peace. Yet such defeatist narratives were absent in the official discussions, with ministers making a firm commitment to additional military aid and sustained support.

We have set up seven preconditions and even by the evaluation of the commission, three out of the seven is not fulfilled. So there is no reason to negotiate membership of Ukraine.” He added that in “my estimation” there were even more conditions Ukraine had not met, but “even three is enough to say that if you haven’t fulfilled the preconditions, there is no chance to start to negotiate”. One the €50bn Ukraine fund, he is clear the EU can either continue with existing funds or find it outside the EU-wide budget – either way that means money from 26, not 27 member states. “The money [for Ukraine] is already in the budget. So [there is] no extra decision to give it [the money] in the short term in longer term, long term and a bigger sum of money. “My position is that we should give it outside but we are not under the pressure of the time because the bridging solution is already in the budget,” he added.', 'lastModifiedDate': '2023-12-14T13:43:05Z'}, {'id': '657ad9d38f0805d21b5761af', 'bodyTextSummary': 'In a new post on social media following his meeting with the French and German leadership, Hungary’s Viktor Orbán said “enlargement is a merit-based process.

A European diplomat agreed, saying they have not detected a shift in the Hungarian leader’s position. The French president, Emmanuel Macron, and German chancellor, Olaf Scholz – together with the presidents of the European Commission and European Council – made a last-minute effort to bring Orbán onboard. Arriving at the summit, the Hungarian prime minister insisted that his position is based on procedural reasoning and a commitment to merit-based decisions: Ukraine, he argued, does not meet the criteria to open accession talks. And in a Facebook post shortly after 11am CET, Orbán said: “To every question the same answer: it is not timely to discuss Ukraine’s EU accession. We don’t support it!” In government-controlled Hungarian media outlets, headlines echoed an intractable position. “Shocking corruption, unhealthy genetically modified grain, cruelly persecuted Transcarpathian Hungarians – and more. We show why Ukrainians are totally unfit for Union membership,” wrote the Orbán-linked news portal Origo in its lead story this morning. But there is still the possibility that the prime minister is leaving himself some room for manoeuvre. Some of the Hungarian government’s communication this week has emphasised an opposition to “fast” accession for Ukraine – even though quick accession is not on the table and it is widely accepted that the process would take years. One option for the prime minister, therefore, if he chooses to back down, would be to claim that he was victorious because he prevented a quick accession. There’s another element at play: some officials note that Orbán loves attention – and has been working to make himself a bigger player on the European stage. For him, getting the summit to revolve around the Hungarian government, with big countries’ leaders rushing to meet with him and every press outlet reporting his comments, could be a win itself. “I wouldn’t discount,” said another European official, “that Orbán wants to look like a global leader.”', 'lastModifiedDate': '2023-12-14T10:34:38Z'}, {'id': '657ad0028f0805d21b57614c', 'bodyTextSummary': 'The Outgoing Dutch prime minister, Mark Rutte, said the timing of the release of €10bn in withheld funds to Hungary on the eve of the EU summit was “unavoidable”. “They had to make the decision by Friday.
