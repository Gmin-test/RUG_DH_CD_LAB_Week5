The Network holds Israel accountable for systematically targeting and killing Al Jazeera journalists and their families. In today’s bombing in Khan Younis, Israeli drones fired missiles at a school where civilians sought refuge, resulting in indiscriminate casualties. Following Samer’s injury, he was left to bleed to death for over 5 hours, as Israeli forces prevented ambulances and rescue workers from reaching him, denying the much-needed emergency treatment. Al Jazeera Media Network extends its sincere condolences to the family in Gaza and in Belgium of the late colleague Samer Abudaqa. With the killing of Samer Abudaqa number of journalists and media workers killed in Gaza reached over 90. Al Jazeera urges the international community, media freedom organisations, and the International Criminal Court to take immediate action to hold the Israeli government and military accountable for these acts of carnage and crimes against humanity.”', 'lastModifiedDate': '2023-12-15T20:19:25Z'}, {'id': '657caa3c8f08a7f5b92672d7', 'bodyTextSummary': 'Details are starting to emerge of the Israeli hostages who were mistakenly killed by the Israel Defense Forces on Friday.

Al Jazeera reports that Abudaqa was trapped in the school for hours and was unable to be reached by paramedics due to heavy Israeli shelling around the area. Meanwhile, Dahdouh, who was hit by shrapnel on the upper arm, was able to reach Nasser hospital, where he was treated for minor injuries, Al Jazeera reports. Dahdouh, whose wife, son, daughter and grandson were killed in an Israeli airstrike in October, had warned that Abudaqa was “critically injured”.\nAt least 63 journalists and media workers in Gaza have been killed by Israeli strikes since 7 October, according to data from the Committee to Protect Journalists. The Israel Defense Forces has said it cannot guarantee the safety of journalists operating in Gaza. Last week, in reference to two Israeli strikes in Lebanon in October, which killed Reuters journalist Issam Abdallah and injured six other journalists, the Human Rights Watch condemned the attacks as an “unlawful and apparently deliberate attack on a very visible group of journalists”. “This is not the first time that Israeli forces have apparently deliberately attacked journalists, with deadly and devastating results,” Ramzi Kaiss, an HRW Lebanon researcher said in last week’s HRW report. Meanwhile, Reporters Without Borders concluded that two journalists who were killed last month in Israeli strikes in Lebanon were “explicitly targeted”.', 'lastModifiedDate': '2023-12-15T20:20:05Z'}, {'id': '657c94ef8f08e82ef8e57e1e', 'bodyTextSummary': 'The German airline carrier Lufthansa has announced that it will resume flights to Tel Aviv starting 8 January 2024.

A group of human rights organisations has brought the case, arguing that supplying the parts contributes to alleged violations of international law by Israel in its war with Hamas, Agence France-Presse reports. The case concerns US-owned F-35 parts stored at a warehouse in the Netherlands and then shipped to several partners, including Israel, via existing export agreements. These parts “make it possible for real bombs to be dropped on real houses and on real families”, said Michiel Servaes, the director of Oxfam Novib, one of the plaintiffs.\nDutch authorities have said it is not clear whether they even have the power to intervene in the deliveries, part of a US-run operation that supplies parts to all F-35 partners. The government said in a letter to parliament: On the basis of current information on the deployment of Israeli F-35s, it cannot be established that the F-35s are involved in serious violations of humanitarian law of war. But Liesbeth Zegveld, a human rights lawyer for the plaintiffs, dismissed that as “nonsense”.', 'lastModifiedDate': '2023-12-15T06:59:02Z'}, {'id': '657bee5a8f08d04fc5205215', 'bodyTextSummary': 'Here are some of the latest images coming in from the Gaza Strip and Israel as Israeli forces continued their bombardment across the Palestinian territory on Friday.', 'lastModifiedDate': '2023-12-15T07:08:13Z'}, {'id': '657bf0998f08d04fc5205218', 'bodyTextSummary': 'Israeli tanks and planes intensified their bombardment of northern Gaza as well as Khan Younis and Rafah in the territory’s south, say residents, authorities and media.

One of the strikes hit a housing block near the Kuwaiti hospital in Rafah, Wafa added.\nLive video footage looking into southern Gaza from Israel after dawn on Friday showed thick, black plumes of smoke rising into the air.

The predictions of a months-long campaign were delivered on camera by Yoav Gallant to a stony-faced Jake Sullivan, the US national security adviser, who had arrived in Israel to convey a message that its campaign needed to change – and preferably be wrapped up in weeks. They were later reinforced by the Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Neyanyahu, who said Israel would not stop until complete victory. The leak about the munitions contradicted claims by the US state department that it had no concerns and no assessment whether Israeli bombing could be in breach of international humanitarian law. More broadly the two issues highlight questions about the nature of the control America has over Israel’s political and military response to Hamas’s bloody attacks of 7 October.

Reuters reports that the comments came as the US said the White House’s national security adviser, Jake Sullivan, would meet with the Palestinian president, Mahmoud Abbas, in Ramallah on the occupied West Bank on Friday about the war in Gaza and ensuring the Hamas attack on Israel on 7 October is never repeated. Sullivan would discuss “ongoing efforts to revamp and revitalise” the Palestinian Authority and reining in “extremist settler violence” against Palestinians in the occupied West Bank, said a US official, who declined to be named. Sullivan said on Thursday that governance of the West Bank and Gaza Strip needed to be connected under a refurbished Palestinian Authority.\nThe official said US-trained Palestinian security forces had performed “incredibly well” in preventing violence instigated by Hamas in the West Bank after the 7 October attack and there were a number of personnel there that could form “some sort of a nucleus” for a future force in the months following Israel’s military campaign. The official said: This is something we’re discussing with the Palestinians and with the Israelis and with regional partners. And it very much remains a work in progress. That is one idea of many. The US president, Joe Biden, remained strongly committed to a two-state solution, but that could not happen as long as Hamas remained the dominant power in Gaza, the official added, also saying: The Palestinian Authority will look to ultimately have a role there, and that is something we are talking about with them.', 'lastModifiedDate': '2023-12-15T06:04:02Z'}, {'id': '657bd3598f08d04fc5205157', 'bodyTextSummary': 'Welcome to a new blog in our continuing live coverage of Israel-Gaza war.

The comments came ahead of a planned meeting between the White House’s national security adviser, Jake Sullivan, and the Palestinian president, Mahmoud Abbas, in the West Bank town of Ramallah on Friday to discuss the war in Gaza. Washington has previously suggested it sees the Palestinian Authority returning to Gaza and playing a key role in any postwar scenario if Hamas is removed from power.\nMeanwhile, Israeli special forces have recovered the body of 28-year-old hostage who was held in Gaza by Hamas since its 7 October attack in southern Israel, the Israeli military said. More on those stories soon. In other news: US president Joe Biden and Jake Sullivan discussed scaling back Israel’s high-intensity operations in Gaza with Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu, Reuters reported a senior US official as saying. Sullivan told Israel’s Channel 12 television he had “constructive” talks with Netanyahu about Israel shifting to a more precise and targeted phase of operations, without giving details or a timeline. The New York Times reported the US was pushing for a shift by new year. Biden has said he wants Israel to “be focused on how to save civilian lives” in Gaza. He said that meant “not stop going after Hamas, but to be more careful”. A White House spokesperson said it wanted Israel’s war in Gaza to “end as soon as possible” but that the US was not dictating a timeline to Israel. All communication and internet services were completely cut off in Gaza on Thursday, Palestinian telecommunication companies said. The Israeli military said soldiers were facing disciplinary action after violating its code of conduct during an “operational activity” near a mosque in the West Bank city of Jenin. The soldiers were seen on video singing Hanukkah songs and mocking the Islamic call to prayer over loudspeaker in the mosque during a raid. The incident came during three days of raids in the occupied West Bank, during which Israeli troops killed 12 Palestinians, including one youth shot dead at a hospital, Palestinian officials and international health charities said. The Palestinian Football Association says it has documented the killing of 85 Palestinian athletes, including 55 football players and 30 players in other sports, since the start of the war, the Palestinian news agency Wafa reported. The association said in a report on Thursday that Israeli forces “targeted Palestinian athletes and sports facilities, especially football players and club presidents, administrators, referees and others”, according to Wafa. At least 18,787 Palestinians have been killed and 50,897 wounded in Israeli strikes on Gaza since 7 October, the Hamas-run Gaza health ministry said on Thursday. The strikes followed Hamas’s attack that killed about 1,200 people in Israel, with more than 200 others taken hostage.', 'lastModifiedDate': '2023-12-15T05:34:49Z'}]}
