The Palestinian Authority “will look to ultimately have a role in Gaza” and that is something the US is talking about with them, according to a senior US official. The comments came as the US said the White House’s national security adviser, Jake Sullivan, would meet with the Palestinian president, Mahmoud Abbas, in Ramallah on Friday. US president Joe Biden and Sullivan discussed scaling back Israel’s high-intensity operations in Gaza with Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu, Reuters reported a senior US official as saying. Sullivan told Israel’s Channel 12 television he had “constructive” talks with Netanyahu about Israel shifting to a more precise and targeted phase of operations, without giving details or a timeline. The New York Times reported the US was pushing for a shift by new year. Biden has said he wants Israel to “be focused on how to save civilian lives” in Gaza. He said that meant “not stop going after Hamas, but to be more careful”. A White House spokesperson said it wanted Israel’s war in Gaza to “end as soon as possible” but that the US was not dictating a timeline to Israel. All communication and internet services were completely cut off in Gaza on Thursday, Palestinian telecommunication companies said. The update came from the territory’s main telecommunication companies, Paltel and Jawwal. The Israeli military said soldiers were facing disciplinary action after violating its code of conduct during an “operational activity” near a mosque in the West Bank city of Jenin. The soldiers were seen on video singing Hanukkah songs and mocking the Islamic call to prayer over loudspeaker in the mosque during a raid. The incident came during three days of raids in the occupied West Bank, during which Israeli troops killed 12 Palestinians, including one youth shot dead at a hospital, Palestinian officials and international health charities said. The Palestinian Football Association says it has documented the killing of 85 Palestinian athletes, including 55 football players and 30 players in other sports, since the start of the war, the Palestinian news agency Wafa reported. The association said in a report on Thursday that Israeli forces “targeted Palestinian athletes and sports facilities, especially football players and club presidents, administrators, referees and others”, according to Wafa. At least 18,787 Palestinians have been killed and 50,897 wounded in Israeli strikes on Gaza since 7 October, a spokesman for the Hamas-run Gaza health ministry said on Thursday.', 'lastModifiedDate': '2023-12-15T03:35:30Z'}, {'id': '657badb08f088fb81bf44235', 'bodyTextSummary': 'The Palestinian Football Association says it has documented the killing of 85 Palestinian athletes, including 55 football players and 30 players in other sports, since the start of the war, the Palestinian news agency Wafa is reporting.

In a video the agency posted on X (formerly Twitter), it says just five hospitals are still functional in Gaza’s south, where most of the strip’s population of more than 2 million is now located. In the video, which shows footage from inside Nasser hospital in Khan Younis, southern Gaza’s biggest city, a 19-year-old expectant mother says that “nowhere is safe”. The area where we were staying was bombed, so we came to the hospital, but there was bombing in this area as well. I mean, there was bombing while we were on the street. There was barely any distance between us and the bombing yesterday.\nThe woman says she also has a nine-month-old daughter she is breastfeeding. When I’m out of milk, I can’t manage to get her more, not even diapers. I also need medication. There’s none in the hospital or in the clinic. ... and this also harms my fetus. The woman says coming to the hospital for pregnancy check-ups is difficult and she needs to come on foot because “there is no functional transportation to get here” or to return home. Because of the ongoing bombing, I could suffer a miscarriage at any moment ... There is no safety in the hospital, at home or at the school.

Associated Press reports that Palestinians freed from detention in the northern town of Beit Lahiya, the Jabaliya refugee camp and Gaza City said they were bound, blindfolded and bundled into the back of trucks. Some said they were taken to the camp at an undisclosed location, nearly naked and with little water. Ibrahim Lubbad, a 30-year-old computer engineer arrested in Beit Lahiya on 7 December with a dozen other family members and held overnight, said: We were treated like cattle, they even wrote numbers on our hands. The roundups have laid bare an emerging tactic in Israel’s ground offensive in Gaza, experts say, as the military seeks to solidify control in evacuated areas in the north and collect intelligence about Hamas operations.\nIn response to questions about alleged mistreatment, the Israeli military said detainees were “treated according to protocol” and given enough food and water. Military spokesman R Adm Daniel Hagari said the men were questioned and then told to dress, and that in cases where that didn’t happen, the military would ensure it did not occur again. Those believed to have ties to Hamas were taken away for further interrogation, and dozens of Hamas members had been arrested, he said. Photos and video showing Palestinian men kneeling in the streets, heads bowed and hands bound behind their backs, have sparked outrage after spreading on social media.', 'lastModifiedDate': '2023-12-15T01:59:23Z'}, {'id': '657ba7d98f0822ad14b8fa5e', 'bodyTextSummary': 'Demonstrations are occurring across the United States calling for a ceasefire in Gaza, as we reported earlier.

It added: While this incident did not involve US forces, we continue to closely monitor the situation. A senior Houthi official on Tuesday warned cargo ships in the Red Sea to avoid travelling towards Israel and the occupied territories, after the Iran-aligned group claimed an attack on a commercial tanker earlier in the day. In solidarity with Palestinians under attack from Israel in Gaza, the Houthis are using their control of Yemen’s western seaboard to mount attacks on what they regard as shipping linked to Israel. They said last Saturday that they would target all ships heading to Israel, regardless of their nationality, and warned international shipping companies against dealing with Israeli ports.', 'lastModifiedDate': '2023-12-15T00:55:34Z'}, {'id': '657b953b8f0822ad14b8f9f4', 'bodyTextSummary': 'The Palestinian Authority “will look to ultimately have a role in Gaza” and that is something the US is talking about with them, according to a senior US official. The comments came as US officials said the White House’s national security adviser, Jake Sullivan, would meet with the Palestinian president, Mahmoud Abbas, in Ramallah on Friday about the war in Gaza and ensuring that the Hamas attack on Israel on 7 October is never repeated, Reuters reports. Sullivan would discuss “ongoing efforts to revamp and revitalise” the Palestinian Authority and reining in “extremist settler violence” against Palestinians in the occupied West Bank, said one of the officials, who declined to be named. Sullivan said on Thursday that governance of the West Bank and Gaza Strip needed to be connected under a refurbished Palestinian Authority.\nThe official said US-trained Palestinian security forces had performed “incredibly well” in preventing violence instigated by Hamas in the West Bank after the 7 October attack and there were a number of personnel there that could form “some sort of a nucleus” for a future force in the months following Israel’s military campaign. The official said: This is something we’re discussing with the Palestinians and with the Israelis and with regional partners. And it very much remains a work in progress. That is one idea of many. The US president, Joe Biden, remained strongly committed to a two-state solution, but that could not happen as long as Hamas remained the dominant power in Gaza, the official added, also saying: The Palestinian Authority will look to ultimately have a role there, and that is something we are talking about with them.', 'lastModifiedDate': '2023-12-15T00:23:52Z'}, {'id': '657b91cd8f08d04fc5204f49', 'bodyTextSummary': 'Israel will fight on until “absolute victory against Hamas”, the country’s prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, has told a senior official from the Biden administration, as another minister said the war could last “more than several months”. Netanyahu’s comments were made to Jake Sullivan, Joe Biden’s national security adviser, during a visit to Israel hours after its defence minister, Yoav Gallant, told Sullivan that many more months were needed to defeat Hamas in Gaza. A statement from Netanyahu’s office said: I told our American friends our heroic fighters have not fallen in vain. From the deep pain of their falling, we are more determined than ever to continue to fight until Hamas is eliminated – until absolute victory. Gallant earlier told Sullivan, apparently contradicting bullish daily updates from Israel’s military about the progress of its campaign, that the war “will require a period of time – it will last more than several months”. He said Hamas had “built infrastructure under the ground and above the ground and it is not easy to destroy them”. The comments were a clear rebuff to the Biden administration, which has been pressing Israel to wind down its offensive, after the US president warned earlier this week that Israel was losing international support.

Recep Tayyip Erdoğan spoke on the phone with the US president, Joe Biden, in their first talks since 7 October, when Hamas’s unprecedented attack on southern Israel sparked the war, Agence France-Presse reports. The Turkish presidency said in a statement after the call: President Erdogan stated that the intensification and prolongation of Israeli attacks could have negative regional and global consequences. Withdrawal of the United States’ unconditional support for Israel can guarantee a rapid ceasefire. Erdogan has been one of the Muslim world’s most vocal critics of Israel’s military tactics in Gaza.

Three others were also arrested in Denmark on apparently related terror offences, and while police in Copenhagen were more circumspect about details, the country’s prime minister Mette Frederiksen said the threat was “as serious as it gets”. Germany’s federal prosecutor said three men were detained in Berlin and the fourth in Rotterdam and were described as “longstanding members of Hamas” with links to its military wing, and who “have participated in Hamas operations abroad”. One of the group, named only as Abdelhamid Al A, was accused by the prosecutor of having “started searching for an underground weapons cache in Europe no later than spring 2023” on the orders of Hamas leaders based in Lebanon. “The weapons were due to be taken to Berlin and kept in a state of readiness in view of potential terrorist attacks against Jewish institutions in Europe,” the prosecutor continued in a statement released on Thursday afternoon. Then, in October 2023, the month of Hamas’s deadly assault on Israel, three of the four men “travelled repeatedly from Berlin to look for the weapons,” the prosecutor continued, with a fourth accused of providing assistance. The German authorities gave the first names and initials of the surname of the four arrested. They were Abdelhamid Al A., born in Lebanon, Mohamed B., an Egyptian National, and Nazih R, a Dutch national who police in the Netherlands said was aged 57. The fourth man Ibrahim El-R., was born in Lebanon. Danish police said that their investigation revealed “a network of people has been preparing a terrorist act,” which ran across international borders, according to Flemming Drejer, a police chief superintendent. Frederiksen, at a meeting with EU leaders in Brussels, offered more context. “It is of course - in relation to Israel and Gaza - completely unacceptable for someone to bring a conflict elsewhere in the world into Danish society,” she said. Israel’s Mossad intelligence agency said that police in Denmark had “arrested seven terrorists acting on behalf of the Hamas terrorist organisation” and had “thwarted an attack, the goal of which was to kill innocent civilians on European soil”.', 'lastModifiedDate': '2023-12-14T18:26:41Z'}, {'id': '657b36c38f088fb81bf43d37', 'bodyTextSummary': 'Here are videos from protesters outside of RSA’s venue, where the fundraiser was being held.

Cameron said: “True long term security of Israel requires there to be a state for Palestine as well. “I think it is best not to put too much weight on one interview and make this thing happen.

One of the UK’s stated reasons for abstaining on a fully fledged ceasefire during a vote at the UN general assembly last week, is that it would leave Hamas, a group opposed to a two-state solution, in power, making a political outcome more difficult. The UK does not make the same point about the Israeli government. Explaining the abstention vote, Cameron said: “An immediate ceasefire, but two state solution: those two things don’t go together. If you have Hamas armed to the teeth launching rockets into Israel and trying to repeat 7 October, you will never have a two-state solution. I know the British can be annoyingly sort of logical factual and down to earth about it.

The Israeli defence minister, Yoav Gallant, told visiting White House national security adviser, Jake Sullivan, on Thursday that it will take several months to defeat Hamas in the Gaza Strip. UK prime minister, Rishi Sunak, has said he still believes in the two-state solution for Israel and Palestine. It comes after the Israeli ambassador to the UK, Tzipi Hotovely, rejected the long-suggested plan in an interview with Sky News on Wednesday night. The UN’s Palestinian refugee chief, Philippe Lazzarini, says people in Gaza are so hungry they are stopping aid trucks, taking the food and eating it right away. He said this was his third visit to Gaza since 7 October, and the situation there is declining rapidly. The Palestinian prime minister, Mohammad Shtayyeh, has said that pressure on the Palestinian Authority to reform is a distraction from the call for peace. Israel’s parliament has approved a wartime budget that adds 25.9bn shekels (£5.5bn) to the national budget. At least 18,787 Palestinians have been killed and 50,897 wounded in Israeli strikes on Gaza since 7 October, the Gaza health ministry spokesman, Ashraf Al-Qidra, said in a statement on Thursday. The IDF have said that more than 70 militants were arrested during an intelligence operation at the Adwan hospital in Gaza City. It added that it had successfully carried out three operations on Hamas sites overnight, including one in a school. The UK is banning Israelis responsible for violence against Palestinians in the West Bank from entering Britain. The foreign secretary, David Cameron, tweeted that “by targeting and killing Palestinian civilians, [they] are undermining security and stability for both Israelis and Palestinians”. Support for Hamas has risen among Palestinians during the conflict, according to an opinion poll by the Palestinian Centre for Policy and Survey Research that shows higher approval levels in the Gaza Strip, which has been hard hit by Israeli attacks. Hamas should recognise Israel and follow the stance of the Palestinian Liberation Organisation, according to senior Hamas official Mousa Abu Marzouk.

Unguided munitions are typically less precise and can pose a greater threat to civilians, especially in such a densely populated area like Gaza.

US security spokesman John Kirby tried to play down the remarks when asked if Biden’s comments were the official position of the US government. Israeli defence minister Yoav Gallant acknowledged the differences with the US but said he was confident the two sides would find a way for Israel’s military operation to continue. Israeli foreign minister Eli Cohen said earlier that his country would continue its war in Gaza “with or without international support”. The Biden administration is delaying the sale of more than 20,000 US-made rifles to Israel over concerns about attacks by Israeli settlers on Palestinians in the occupied West Bank, two sources familiar with the matter have said. The state department sent an informal notification for the sale to Congress several weeks ago but the sale has not gone ahead, despite being cleared by Senate and House committees. Israel has announced its worst combat losses in six weeks after an ambush in the ruins of Gaza, saying on Wednesday that 10 of its soldiers had been killed over the past 24 hours.
