Yesterday evening, the leaders reached a historic deal to open accession talks with Ukraine and Moldova. However, overnight they were unable to reach an agreement on revising the bloc’s budget and on a €50bn package for Ukraine, due to opposition from Hungarian prime minister, Viktor Orbán. Orbán told Hungarian radio today that he can still stop Ukraine’s accession at numerous points in the long process. The prime minister hinted he would link extra funding for Ukraine to the unfreezing of more EU funds for Hungary, suspended over rule-of-law concerns. Estonia’s Kaja Kallas said: “Ukraine will not be left without support.” The European Council president, Charles Michel, said after the summit that he is “confident” the bloc will “be in a position to fulfil on our promises to support Ukraine with financial means.” When it comes to the financial package for Ukraine, the European Commission president, Ursula von der Leyen said the commission will use the time until the next summit “to ensure that whatever happens at this next [European Council], we will have an operational solution”. French President Emmanuel Macron said Orbán must not be allowed to take the EU as “hostage” but that he believed the Hungarian leader would “show responsibility”. Belgium’s Alexander De Croo said that when it comes to Israel and Gaza, “what should be our objective is that the human suffering should end, on both sides”. Ireland’s Leo Varadkar said “we now have a clear majority of countries here in the European Union calling for a ceasefire.” The EU’s 27 leaders “had a strategic debate” on the Middle East and agreed that they will “continue to discuss in the future”. Michel underscored the EU’s commitment to humanitarian aid and access, as well as a political process.', 'lastModifiedDate': '2023-12-15T16:30:04Z'}, {'id': '657c7a3b8f08a7f5b9266faa', 'bodyTextSummary': 'The German chancellor, Olaf Scholz, has underscored continued support for Ukraine.

Both he and German chancellor Olaf Scholz at his press conference said the Hungarian leader’s decision was “respected” as part of the democratic process. Scholz revealed he told Orbán during the summit that he could criticise the European Commission report on enlargement but he could not link things that were not linked and block the decision on enlargement because of complaints about the commission withholding funds for Hungary. “He could have blocked. He did not do it. So he let Europe send a positive political signal to Ukraine, which, in this respect, is, I believe, an important element.

If the seven rules are met, then you will need to be able to open discussions,” Macron told reporters.

Speaking about the proposed revision of the EU budget, von der Leyen noted that the current long-term budget, which runs from 2021 until 2027, was designed before the current crises facing Europe. The first priority is Ukraine, followed by migration, boosting competitiveness and addressing natural disasters and humanitarian crisis, she said. She noted that 26 countries agreed on the proposal on the table. “This is a good result,” she said, adding that tough choices were required.

And hopefully when we come back here in January or February we’ll be able to agree a package of financial support for Ukraine. On the Middle East, he said there was no a “clear majority” for a ceasefire in but they had agreed at this point not to draw up conclusions or a declaration and they would return to the subject in the new year. I think if we’d tried to have written conclusions we would have been here for many, many hours. And probably have only come up with compromise wording that nobody would have been happy with. But I think it is very clear that there was a very good discussion, a strategic discussion on the Middle East. The room has changed since we last discussed this back in October. There is now a very clear majority in the European Union for humanitarian ceasefire for an end to the conflict.', 'lastModifiedDate': '2023-12-15T14:39:56Z'}, {'id': '657c60798f08a7f5b9266dc4', 'bodyTextSummary': 'Charles Michel also addressed the leaders’ discussion on the situation in the Middle East.

He added: There is strong unity around the guarantee of security for Israel. Israel has the right to its security, it has the right to exist. And that’s why on repeated occasions we have continued to condemn Hamas’s terrorist attacks and the choice of Hamas to use civilians as human shields. We urge and call upon Hamas to release unconditionally the remaining hostages – immediately. And we also repeat that the right to defend itself in Israel has to be carried out in compliance with international law. And we reiterate again also that humanitarian support and aid must be guaranteed. Among some of the members of the European Council, there are different feelings and sentiments about the idea of a pause, a humanitarian pause, supported by others, and a humanitarian ceasefire, supported by others. But the essential points, I think, are linked to two points: joint commitment to further support and offer support on humanitarian aid, and to ensure that humanitarian access for aid is open … Another essential point is not just to reiterate the traditional standpoint of the EU, but its commitment to the political process for a two-state solution. And that means that the European Union countries have to work in an accelerated way to build upon this … Some people said that we should, quite rightly, condemn the increasing attacks led by settlers against Palestinians in the West Bank.

The majority of EU countries are now calling for a ceasefire, that’s very clear from the UN vote the other day, but there are one or two who are not because they believe that it would prevent Israel from pursuing Hamas terrorists. I don’t agree with that interpretation. You can pursue terrorists without engaging in the kind of war and destruction that Israel is engaging in at the moment.
